# Project Name : Orinoco

![Orinoco Logo](./frontend/img/logo.png)

Orinoco is an e-commerce platform that has been developed with the concept of a mono-product site. The backend side has been already done but the fron-end side has been fully developed by me...I mean the development & the design part. 
This platform allows us to select items with a desired quantity and add them to the cart. Then you can order them by filling out the contact form. You'll get a confirm message containing the order Id and the total cost after sending the form. 
Of course, you could also delete the selected items inividually or all at once before making the order.
